Pokedevs Live Demo

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Pokemon TCG API

I have initiated this project because i love pokemon, obviously but I have never really liked the Pokemon Cards, and this idea came to my mind to really know more about Pokemon Cards and the Market behind it.
The Pokemon TCG API provides not only the original Pokemon Cards but also a link to the Maket Info for each Pokemon Card.
When you enter the Pokedevs, it will give you a sample of 28 random cards, when you click in the cards, you will go directly to the Market Info of the card you selected.

Optimizations
(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
