Pokedevs Live Demo

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Pokemon TCG API

I have initiated this project because i love pokemon, obviously but I have never really liked the Pokemon Cards, and this idea came to my mind to really know more about Pokemon Cards and the Market behind it.
The Pokemon TCG API provides not only the original Pokemon Cards but also a link to the Maket Info for each Pokemon Card.
When you enter the Pokedevs, it will give you a sample of 28 random cards, when you click in the cards, you will go directly to the Market Info of the card you selected.

You can also search for a specific pokemon name, see the results for "Weedle":

Optimizations
The project isn't done yet, and I'm tryng to implement the following functionalities, when a functionality have been sucessfully i will check here.:
-> Search Pokemon By Type (Grass, psychic etc..)
-> Make the results in the search maintain the same size indifferent of the number of results.

Lessons Learned:
Api handling is really really hard, also the random results and the poor documentation is really not begginner friendly, so i struggled a lot before i understand how i can implement the Pokemon TCG API.
Pacience, this is the key.
